description: Following signs in the heavens, Artaban--a priest of the Magi--embarks
  on a journey to bring gifts of sapphire, ruby, and pearl to the newborn king of
  the Jews. Intending to meet the caravan bearing the other three wise men across
  the desert, he stops to aid a dying man and misses the caravan. Artaban is willing
  to do whatever he must to complete his journey, but it seems luck is not on his
  side. Despite his best efforts, the quest may not be one he is able to complete.
